# TrustlessEscrow Protocol
After understanding the fundamentals of blockchain and the problem it stands to solve, as part of my learning journey, I decided to build TrustlessEscrow.

## About the project

TrustlessEscrow is a multi-party escrow system with dispute resolution built on Ethereum-compatible blockchains. It solves real freelancer payment problems by enabling milestone-based payments, arbitration, and trustless fund management without requiring centralized intermediaries.

**Problem:** Freelancers and clients often face payment disputes, where neither party trusts the other to fulfill their obligations. Traditional escrow services charge 5-10% fees or more and can be biased.

**Solution:** A smart contract-based escrow system that:
- Holds funds in code, not in a company's hands
- Enables milestone-based releases
- Provides decentralized arbitration
- Supports multiple payment tokens (ETH, ERC20)
- Has emergency recovery mechanisms

**Target Users:**
- Freelancers (developers, designers, writers)
- Clients (individuals, small businesses, DAOs)
- Arbitrators (trusted community members for now but I read there are approaches to build decentralized arbitration too)
